# 🫀 Heart Disease Prediction APP

✨ Why This Project?
"Can a handful of numbers really tell us something about your heart?"
Turns out—yes, with the right approach, they can.

This project started with a simple mission:
🩺 "What if anyone could get a quick, data-based estimate of heart disease risk—right from a web request?"

Here’s what makes it meaningful (and fun):

📊 Built on real medical data – No guessing games. The model learns from actual clinical records.

🚀 Lightweight and fast – No bloated code or bulky tools. It’s just Python, a trained model, and a simple API.

🧪 Easy to test and extend – Want to use it in a web app or mobile app? You totally can.

🔍 Focused prediction – It only takes 8 inputs—no exhaustive lab reports required.

Whether you’re a beginner learning to serve ML models, a data science enthusiast, or just someone curious about combining code and health, this project is designed to be understandable, practical, and ready to use.
